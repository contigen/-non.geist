# non.geist

A package to use Vercelʼs typefaces, [Geist](https://vercel.com/font)－ Sans & Mono, for non-Next.js projects.

## The Why

I tried to use [geist-font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geist) in a React project, it errored out. I like the flexibility a package offers － not having to manage assets (or dependencies); I take it a lot of devs prefer this, maybe. Now, itʼs not much to `@font-face` a font (or typeface), itʼs even easier with [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts). More importantly, itʼs a learning opportunity for me, like every other project.
